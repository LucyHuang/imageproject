    <h1>How to make a healthy sleep environment, according to science. <img id=emoji src="img/sleeping_emoji.png" alt="sleepingemoji">

    <p>With the National Sleep Foundation’s Sleep Awareness Week coming up in April, it is more obvious than ever that Americans need more sleep. According to a report published by CDC in 2016, one in three adults are not getting enough sleep. In a survey
      conducted by Statista in 2017, 20 percent of adults in America said they go to bed after midnight and 36 percent wake up tired in the morning. Americans are also having difficulty falling asleep. Nineteen percent of Americans reported having difficulty
      unwinding in the evening.
    </p>

    <p>As the head of marketing communications for a tech company, Joanna Madej is used to running of five and half hours of sleep during stressful work weeks. Her sleep deprivation is worsened by jetlag. When Madej has trouble falling asleep she turns to
      homeopathic sleep aids. “I drink valerian root tea with chamomile,” said Madej “if it is intense I use melatonin.” About six months ago, she started taking time out to power down before bed. “I often do yoga for sleep and I mediate” said Madej.
    </p>

    <p>Like Madej, most Americans would love to have eight to nine hours of sleep a night. While getting more sleep seems almost impossible, there are ways to improve your sleep. Many studies have shown that simple changes in sleep hygiene can help you fall
      asleep faster and get more restful sleep. The term sleep hygiene was first used by psychologist Peter Hauri in 1977, when he published 10 sleep hygiene rules. Some of the rules include going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day, keeping
      the bedroom at a cool temperature and eliminating noise from the bedroom.
    </p>

    <p>Today, sleep hygiene is a recognized and commonly used treatment option for people with mild to moderate insomnia. Since Hauri’s original guidelines, sleep experts have modified the list to include limiting the use of electronics before bed. In a
      press release from the CDC, the director of the CDC’s Division of Population Health discusses about the benefits of sleep hygiene. “Lifestyle changes such as going to bed at the same time each night; rising at the same time each morning; and turning
      off or removing televisions, computers, mobile devices from the bedroom, can help people get the healthy sleep they need” said Wayne Giles M.D.
